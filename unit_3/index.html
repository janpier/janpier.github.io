<p>Known by its phonetic spelling and otherworldly aesthetic, the visual
art and music project known as /ˈloosid/ first appeared in late 2014
with several rapid releases, including a dreamy remix of John Mayer’s
cover of “Free Fallin’” which rapidly garnered much support and
a substantial following. Since then, the futuristic project has remained
cloaked in mystery while developing an unmistakable yet indefinable
style that bends genres as much as it bends minds. With
flowing bass-heavy rhythms and warped percussions oozing vibes of
musical surrealism, the project has been tapped to apply that style to
The Chainsmokers’ “Roses”, Galantis’ “Gold Dust”, Dropout’s
“Slowly”, and Don Diablo’s “Universe”. The single “I Want U” was
picked up as the first release on Big Beat’s White Label in late 2015.</p>
