    <nav><h1>About</h1> Since their appearance in late 2014, the visual art and music project known as Loosid  has consistently defied easy categorization and constantly transcended  labels so frequently found in the dance music scene. With an ethereal sound that first exploded onto the scene with a remix of John Mayer’s cover of “Free Fallin’", Loosid has been not-so-quiety gathering recognition with every release.
After signing with heavyweight CAA, Loosid surpassed the 2 million view mark for "Clouds" (feat Raycee Jones) on Monstercat and delivered a massive remix of The Chainsmokers “Roses” (with over 1 Million Streams on Spotify).
This has only served to increase the demand for their musical talents, as well as eagerly received remixes for Galantis, Gallant, Dropout, Don Diablo, and Matoma as loosid  has successfully exported its surrealist sounds, flowing rhythms and warped percussions to eager audiences worldwide.

        <p>The magic of the digital age is quite contradicting. Each artist has the ability to seek out and find the kind of people they think would like their stuff, and send them what we bloggers call a "submission". However, this strategy is still not as good as if the song were picked up out of pure research. The majority of viral hits don't need submission, and that's the contradiction. Here I have a picture perfect contradiction, straight from the experimental styles of Loosid.</p>

        <aside class="picture"> <div><h1>ASIDE</h1> I've never come across a John Mayer remix that I was into, but this one is just dandy. Loosid slows down Free Fallin to the extent you can't recognize the original riff, and allows the vocals to become a deep, drowned out sound. Then he picks it back up, adding his own 1-2 kick arrangement that melds it all together. It's fantastic to see a mainstream hit from a highly respectable artist circle back around in such a different form, especially a form that is highly popular amongst music junkies. Somehow I came to the conclusion that this track is a "hip-hop serenade with downtempo influence". A technical term for an extremely fun.</div> </aside>
